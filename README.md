# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

## Overview

Hi this is my first time doing challenge from front end mentor. Nervous and anxiety at beginning.

### The challenge

My challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge (great) 

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I am aiming to be good in bootstrap so I thought of not invent the new wheel and just use what they has built. Please correct me if I am wrong in using the Bootstrap code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5.0

### What I learned

  First I built I have struggle in making the round at the top, and middle the Annual Plan and price have a lot of gap, after I saw others post of their finished work then I learn how the did it. Can see my screenshot before at my github: https://github.com/kmeganiz/OrderSummary


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
    <div class="row justify-content-center mt-5">
```
The justify can't work when I put at container

```css
  body {background-repeat: repeat-x;}
```
Realize we can make the background repeat in X - index

### Continued development

I still see that between the image and the card there is a thin white line before the shadow there. Anyone can help me how to remove that?

### Useful resources

- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/ - This helped me for not invent the new wheel.
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp - This is to learn how to make the box corner rounded. Realize can customize only top left or right to be rounded.
